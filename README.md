# ✦ Memorable

**Persistent memory and personal context for Claude Code.**

## What is Memorable?

Memorable is a Claude Code plugin that gives Claude persistent memory and personal context across sessions. It uses seed files to define who you are, who Claude is, and what's happening right now. These seeds are loaded automatically at the start of every session through Claude Code hooks, so Claude always starts with the context it needs.

A web UI served at `localhost:7777` lets you manage your seeds, browse session notes, upload context files, and track your token budget. Everything is visual, everything is local, and nothing leaves your machine.

The differentiator: Memorable isn't just memory storage. Other tools solve retrieval. Memorable solves *presence* — it's the system that makes Claude feel like someone who knows you.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deflating/memorable-plugin.git
cd memorable-plugin
bash plugin/install.sh
python3 plugin/server.py
# Open http://localhost:7777
```

The install script creates the `~/.memorable/` directory structure, writes default config, and installs hooks into your Claude Code environment.

## What's Included

- **Seed File Editor** — Visual form builder for `user.md` (who you are) and `agent.md` (how Claude should behave). Toggle sections on/off, use presets, import existing markdown.
- **Session Notes Browser** — Browse and search session notes with salience scoring. Notes are generated by the daemon as you work.
- **Memory Effectiveness Insights** — See loaded-vs-referenced memory yield so you can tune note quality and relevance.
- **Context File Manager** — Upload documents with configurable anchor depths (Full, Detailed, Summary, None). Link files to projects.
- **Token Budget Visualization** — Real-time token usage across seeds, agent config, and context files.
- **Settings** — Configure LLM provider, daemon behavior, and token budget.

In the **Memories** area, memory is organized into:
- **Session Notes** — episodic memory from past sessions.
- **Now Context** — your current `now.md` working context.
- **Knowledge Docs** — semantic memory documents and depth controls.

## How It Works

1. **Hooks** load your seed files at session start, giving Claude your full context before you say anything.
2. **The web UI** at `localhost:7777` lets you edit seeds, upload files, and manage configuration.
3. **Session notes** track what happens across conversations. The daemon watches your sessions and generates scored notes automatically (coming soon).
4. **Everything is stored locally** in `~/.memorable/data/`. No cloud, no database server, just files.

Server module responsibilities:
- `plugin/server.py` — thin CLI entrypoint.
- `plugin/server_http.py` — HTTP handler, routing, static serving, server startup.
- `plugin/server_api.py` — endpoint/business logic.
- `plugin/server_storage.py` — shared paths, config/storage helpers, constants.

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.memorable/data/config.json`. Key settings:

- **LLM endpoint** — URL, API key, and model name for the LLM used by the daemon and anchor processor (default: DeepSeek)
- **Token budget** — Maximum token allocation for startup context (default: 200K)
- **Daemon** — On/off toggle and idle detection threshold
- **Server port** — Default 7777

## Seeds

Three seed files define your Claude experience:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `user.md` | Your profile — identity, about, values, communication style, people, projects |
| `agent.md` | Agent configuration — traits, behaviors, avoid list, technical style |
| `now.md` | Current state and context — manually maintained, changes as your focus shifts |

Seeds are stored at `~/.memorable/data/seeds/` and loaded in order at every session start.
